# Windows

## Step 1: Install Python

You can download Python for Windows from the website https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.4.1/. After downloading the ***.msi** file, you should run it (double-click on it) and follow the instructions there. It is important to remember the path (the directory) where you installed Python. It will be needed later!
