## Step 1: Prepare for the Installfest

You must bring:

* **Your laptop.** You need to have a working wifi connection and a browser.
  * If you have a choice between a Mac and a Windows laptop, please bring the Mac.
  * Linux is an acceptable alternative, but the Installfest is only tested on Ubuntu.
* **Power cord for your laptop**

Possibly also helpful to bring:

* Extension cord
* Power strip
* Camera
* Snacks

## Step 2: Don't Panic!

Even if you get stuck, please go through the rest of the instructions and download all the things you'll need. Bandwidth will be at a premium during the workshop, so it will help immensely to have everything on your laptop already.

There are a lot of steps, and the instructions may seem like they're in a foreign language, but: don't panic! By the end of the workshop, you'll know what everything is and how to use it.

## Step 3: Read This Overview
