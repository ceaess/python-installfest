## Step 1: Check for Python

It is very likely that you already have Python installed out of the box. To check if you have it installed (and which version it is), open a console and type the following command:

    $ python3 --version
    Python 3.5.0

If you see the above, you can skip step 2.

## Step 2: Install Python

If you don't have Python installed or if you want a different version, you can install it as follows:

#### Ubuntu

Type this command into your console:

    sudo apt-get install python3.5

#### Fedora

Use this command in your console:

    sudo yum install python3.5

## Step 3: Check for Python Again

Repeat Step 1 to make sure that Python is now installed.
